### Description
Polly is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device for individuals that cannot communicate verbally. It is specially designed for young children. This app was inspired by my nephew, Liam. He is on the autism spectrum and is non-verbal. With this app, Liam will be able to communicate his needs. He will be able to drag a photo or multiple ones, and have them read out loud. His parents will also be able to upload new photos to the database and add them so Liam will have more photos to select from. They will also be able to edit the profile section in order to show Liam's age, name and photo. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Technology/ Assistive Technology
- **Tablet:** This app is primarily developed and designed to be used in a tablet device. It is currently designed as a desktop app in order to show functionality and design. 
- **Story:** Users can communicate their needs by selecting one or multiple photos, dropping them in the input bar, and having the photos read out loud. Users can also upload new photos along with a label. Lastly, users can edit and input their information in the profile section. 
- **Market:** This app is intended to be used for individuals with speech or language impairments. 
- **Habit:** This app is meant to be used multiple times a day, every day. 
- **Scope:** Ideally, this app would be available in any app store. It would provide an alternative to other AAC devices that might charge the user for using the app.
